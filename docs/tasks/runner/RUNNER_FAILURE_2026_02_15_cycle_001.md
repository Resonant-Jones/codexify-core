You are conducting an evidence-based audit of the target repo. Do not guess; prefer file-path references (and line ranges if available). Do not ask follow-up questions before starting—if something is ambiguous, record it explicitly as a finding with evidence and a proposed “discovery” command.

PRIMARY GOAL
Produce ONE runner-consumable JSON object (printed to stdout) that conforms to the following template exactly (field names + overall structure), derived from mega_audit_output.schema.json:

IMPORTANT: Set `agent.model` to the **exact runtime model id** you are running (example: `gpt-5.3-codex`).
- **Do NOT** use generic names like `GPT-5`, `GPT-4`, `o1`, etc.
- If you cannot determine the exact runtime model id, set it to `"unknown"` and add a **runner_ready_finding** with:
  - area: `dx`
  - severity: `WARN`
  - title: `MODEL-ID-UNKNOWN`
  - suggested_commands: commands to discover the model id in your runtime

HARD FAIL SELF-CHECK (before printing): If your JSON would contain `"model":"GPT-5"` (or any other generic model label), do **not** print it. Fix `agent.model` first.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES
- Output MUST be valid JSON (no trailing commas, no comments).
- Output MUST be the ONLY thing you print (no preambles like "thinking", no logs, no explanations).
- Output MUST be the ONLY thing you print (no prose, no markdown, no code fences, no "thinking" blocks, no tool logs).
- Do NOT write any files to the repo in this stage.
- The `reports[].path` values are INTENDED output locations for a later stage (Campaign Runner will write actual markdown reports). Use the same paths that the previous markdown-based version required.

INTENDED REPORTS (DO NOT WRITE THEM HERE)
The JSON must describe these two intended repo-written artifacts (paths recorded under `reports[]`):

1) A full “Senior Architect” system audit report (security/privacy/sovereignty + drift + DX + performance + risk register)
2) A Codexify MVP Roadmap & Core Loop Plan focused on closing the 6 core loops end-to-end

WORKTREE HYGIENE

- Begin with: git status --porcelain -uall
- If any untracked/modified files exist that are not required to produce the JSON output:
  - Do NOT delete or modify them.
  - Do NOT stop to ask what to do.
  - Add a finding with:
    - area: "other"
    - severity: "WARN"
    - title: "WORKTREE-DRIFT"
    - suggested_commands: cleanup commands
  - Continue, producing ONLY the JSON output.

SCORING (IN FINDINGS)
For each of the 6 core loops, ensure you include findings that enable the campaign compiler to compute two statuses:

- Code Present: (stubbed|partial|complete)
- Loop Closed: (yes|no) with explicit closure requirements: auth outside dev proxy, persistence via backend list, deterministic validation path.

MVP ASSUMPTION
For MVP, “works locally with documented env vars/services configured” is acceptable.
Do not require production hardening unless it blocks local end-to-end loop closure.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (EVIDENCE-FIRST)

- Only assert what you can prove from code/config/docs in the repo.
- For every important claim, include file paths; include line ranges where possible.
- If you cannot access code or run commands, state that clearly and do not guess. In that case set evidence.lines to "unknown" and include discovery commands.
- Be ruthless about MVP scope: anything not needed to close a core loop goes to Deferred (severity INFO with explicit deferral notes).

RUNNER-READY FINDINGS MANIFEST (AUTHORITATIVE)
Populate `runner_ready_findings` such that:

- Every major gap you identify MUST correspond to at least one finding.
- Every RISK/WARN item you surface MUST be represented as a finding.
- Each finding MUST include:
  - evidence[] with at least one entry (file + lines or unknown)
  - suggested_task_outcome: an observable “done” statement
  - suggested_commands: exact commands to validate / reproduce (or to remove ambiguity)
  - dependencies: list required env vars/services/containers, or []

SEVERITY SUMMARY
Compute `reports[0].severity_summary` as counts of findings by severity across `runner_ready_findings`.

DERIVED CAMPAIGNS
In `derived_campaigns`, propose one-or-more campaign groupings using only the findings you emitted.
- Each derived_campaign MUST reference findings by ID.
- Use campaign_id format: CAMPAIGN_YYYY_MM_DD_<SLUG>
- campaign_type guidance:
  - security: findings primarily in area security/sovereignty
  - mvp: findings primarily in area core-loop/dx/testing
  - followup: cleanup / deferred / long-tail

BEGIN by scanning the repository now, then output ONLY the JSON object described above.
