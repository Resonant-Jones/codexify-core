# TASK-2026-01-20-011_DOCUMENT_CHUNKING_STRATEGY_MINIMAL: Add document chunking

## Task Prompt
### Context
You are operating in the Codexify repo to extend the document upload pipeline for the
`CAMPAIGN-2026-01-20-003_MVP_LOOP_CLOSURE_DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_PARSING` campaign.

### Instructions
1. Implement deterministic fixed-size chunking with overlap for long documents.
2. Only chunk when `parsed_text` exceeds the threshold; otherwise keep a single chunk.
3. Preserve ordering with explicit chunk indices.
4. Keep scope limited to allowed files and run `pytest -v`.
5. Use two-phase commits with the provided commit messages.

### Task Description
Goal: Implement pragmatic chunking (fixed-size + overlap) for long documents so embeddings are stable and retrieval is useful.

Constraints / Requirements
- Chunking must be deterministic and stable for the same input text.
- Use a simple fixed-size character window with overlap (no semantic chunking required).
- Define conservative defaults (e.g., `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`) and make them easy to tune.
- Only chunk when `parsed_text` exceeds a threshold (e.g., `> chunk_size`), otherwise store a single chunk.
- Preserve ordering (each chunk should carry an index).
- Do not break existing upload flows.
- No unrelated refactors.

### Expected Output
- Long document text is split into ordered, overlapping chunks.
- A focused unit test proves chunking behavior (size, overlap, determinism).
- Task artifact recorded with prompt verbatim, commands + results, clean git status, and hashes.
