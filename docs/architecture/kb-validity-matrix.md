# KB Validity Matrix

## Purpose

- Classify the architecture documentation corpus before diagram generation or planning reuse.
- Separate current runtime truth from supplemental deep dives, design canon, and legacy identity drift.

## Interpretation Rules

- For short-horizon operational truth, `00-current-state.md` wins.
- For first-pass runtime diagrams, use only the validated runtime diagram source set.
- Older deep dives may be referenced only when explicitly marked supplementary and verified against code.
- UI canon documents are design canon only; they are not backend runtime truth.
- Docs that still name Threadspace, `guardian-backend_v2`, GuardianOS, or bundled installer assumptions are quarantine-only and are not valid first-pass runtime inputs.

## Classification Legend

- `authoritative_now`: current runtime or KB routing truth for March 2026; safe to treat as present-state evidence within the file's stated scope.
- `supplementary_verify_against_code`: useful context, but verify against current code and the March 2026 KB set before using it.
- `design_canon_not_runtime_truth`: valid for UI or conceptual diagrams, not for first-pass current runtime topology.
- `historical_archive`: retained for history only; do not use as a first-pass architecture diagram source.
- `misleading_identity_drift`: legacy material likely to confuse current product identity, supported install path, or present runtime behavior; quarantine it from first-pass diagramming.

## Audit Matrix

Audit notes:

- Actual repo paths are listed below when the requested shorthand path points to a file stored elsewhere in this repo.
- Not present at audit time: `/docs/architecture/RELEASE.md`, `/Thread-Artifact-Lineage.md`.

| path | domain | status | safe_for_runtime_diagrams | safe_for_ui_diagrams | reason | recommended_action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/docs/architecture/00-current-state.md` | release / operational truth | `authoritative_now` | yes | no | Explicitly declares itself the canonical short-form source of truth for release readiness, supported install path, and active blockers. | Read first and let it override older or broader docs on short-horizon reality. |
| `/docs/architecture/README.md` | KB routing | `authoritative_now` | yes | no | Current KB entrypoint updated in March 2026 and aligned to the current architecture set. | Use as the routing layer after reading this matrix. |
| `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md` | runtime topology | `authoritative_now` | yes | no | Explicitly frames itself as current runtime architecture and topology, with March 2026 source anchors. | Use as the base node-and-boundary source for runtime diagrams. |
| `/docs/architecture/flows.md` | runtime flows | `authoritative_now` | yes | no | Documents implemented trigger-to-output flows with concrete route, worker, and queue anchors. | Use for sequence and flow diagrams after `system-overview.md`. |
| `/docs/architecture/data-and-storage.md` | persistence and invariants | `authoritative_now` | yes | no | Maps current storage systems, entities, and invariants used by the runtime. | Use for data-store, entity, and persistence-boundary diagrams. |
| `/docs/architecture/config-and-ops.md` | runtime config and operator truth | `authoritative_now` | yes | no | Updated March 2026 and scoped to current config precedence, health surfaces, worker dependencies, and supported run paths. | Use to constrain deployment/runtime diagrams to supported paths. |
| `/docs/architecture/modules-and-ownership.md` | subsystem map | `authoritative_now` | yes | no | Describes current subsystem seams and dependency edges with explicit code anchors. | Use for component maps and ownership overlays. |
| `/docs/architecture/roadmap-signals.md` | planning guidance | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | The file explicitly surfaces planning signals, refactor leverage, and sequencing suggestions rather than present-state topology. | Use only for future-state annotations after the current runtime diagram is complete. |
| `/docs/architecture/tech-debt-and-risks.md` | current risk register | `authoritative_now` | no | no | March 2026 evidence-backed risk register is current, but it is not a topology source. | Use after baseline diagramming to annotate risk hotspots or release caveats. |
| `/docs/architecture/completion_pipeline.md` | older completion deep dive | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | Useful runtime detail, but it is an older deep dive and the KB entrypoint already warns to verify it against current routes/workers. | Use only as a secondary detail source after `flows.md` and code verification. |
| `/docs/architecture/providers.md` | provider notes | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | Provider behavior can drift from catalog/router/runtime truth; this file is narrower than the March 2026 operator docs. | Verify against current provider registry, catalog, health, and code before using it. |
| `/docs/architecture/chat-runtime-contract.md` | chat runtime contract | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | Normative runtime vocabulary for provider state and request state, but it is a semantics contract rather than a topology source. | Use for request-state interpretation after verifying against current code and runtime evidence. |
| `/docs/architecture/identity-precedence-contract.md` | identity precedence contract | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | Normative identity-layer precedence and actor/posture contract.

| `/docs/architecture/delegation-runtime.md` | delegation runtime contract | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | Current delegation seam, runtime contract, and source-thread provenance rules; useful for operator reasoning, but not first-pass topology source material. | Use for delegation planning and operator reasoning after current runtime verification. |

| `/docs/architecture/guardian-agent-delegation-recon.md` | delegation planning recon | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | Explicit planning/recon document mixing `Verified`, `Inference`, and missing-doc notes; superseded for day-to-day use by the delegation runtime and operator manual docs. | Use only for historical delegation planning context, not first-pass runtime diagramming. |
| `/docs/architecture/solo-operator-runtime-bootcamp.md` | operational runbook | `supplementary_verify_against_code` | no | no | Practical operator training guide, not a runtime architecture source. | Use for operator onboarding only. |

| `/docs/guardian/iddb_policy_v1.md` | identity data policy | `design_canon_not_runtime_truth` | no | no | Policy/design contract for identity handling; not a description of current runtime topology.

It is useful for framing and future workflow design, but it does not describe implemented runtime topology, supported-path behavior, or release truth. | Read `00-current-state.md` first, then use this pack for product framing, consulting language, and future workflow design only; do not use it as runtime proof, release evidence, or a runtime diagram source. |

| `/docs/Codexify/SECURITY.md` | legacy security policy | `historical_archive` | no | no | External program/version policy doc is not tied to the March 2026 runtime KB. | Do not use for architecture diagram generation. |

## Required Judgments

- The March 2026 architecture KB set is treated as `authoritative_now`, except where the file explicitly frames itself as planning-only. In this audit, that exception is `/docs/architecture/roadmap-signals.md`.
- `/docs/architecture/completion_pipeline.md` and `/docs/architecture/providers.md` are `supplementary_verify_against_code`.
- The UI token, layout, rendering, diagnostics, and perceptual canons under `/docs/dev/ARTIFACT*.md` are `design_canon_not_runtime_truth`. They can inform UI diagrams, but they must not be treated as current backend/runtime topology without verification.
- `/docs/specs/organizational-cognition/README.md` is `design_canon_not_runtime_truth`. It is valid for conceptual product framing and future workflow design, but not for runtime topology, runtime diagrams, or release-proof claims.
- Docs that still present `Threadspace`, `guardian-backend_v2`, GuardianOS/plugin-system topology, or obsolete packaged-installer assumptions are classified as `historical_archive` or `misleading_identity_drift` based on how likely they are to confuse present product identity, supported install path, or current runtime behavior.
- `misleading_identity_drift` is used when a file could actively confuse current product identity, supported install path, or present runtime behavior. `historical_archive` is used when a file is primarily dated context rather than an active identity hazard.
