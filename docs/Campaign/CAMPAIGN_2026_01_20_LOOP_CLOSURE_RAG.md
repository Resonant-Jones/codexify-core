# Campaign Conventions (Source of Truth)

- **Campaign files** live under `docs/Campaign/` and use **underscore** naming:
  - `CAMPAIGN_YYYY_MM_DD.md`
- **CAMPAIGN-ID** and **TASK-ID** use **dash** date formatting:
  - `CAMPAIGN-2026-01-20-001_*`
  - `TASK-2026-01-20-006_*`
- **Task prompt artifacts** are created on-demand under `docs/tasks/` and use **underscore** naming:
  - `docs/tasks/TASK_YYYY_MM_DD_NNN_<slug>.md`
- When a TASK is complete, mark it ✅ and (when known) include the task artifact filename.

## CAMPAIGN_2026_01_20_001_MVP_

CAMPAIGN-ID: CAMPAIGN-2026-01-20-001_MVP_LOOP_CLOSURE_RAG

## Mission

Close the Memory/RAG + Guardian Chat loop so the system reliably:

- stores memory
- retrieves memory in a new thread
- proves retrieval with automated coverage

## Definition of Done

✅ Manual loop works: "Remember X" → new thread → "What is X?" → correct answer  
✅ Health endpoint exists for vector store (or equivalent)  
✅ Integration test exists and runs green in CI/dev  
✅ No unrelated refactors

## Task List (execute in order)

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-001_CHAT_ENDPOINT_CANONICALIZATION

Goal: Identify and consolidate canonical chat send endpoint usage in backend routing and docs.

- Output: single documented canonical endpoint; reduce ambiguity.
- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_001_chat_endpoint_canonicalization.md`

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-002_VECTOR_STORE_HEALTH_ENDPOINT

Goal: Add a health endpoint that verifies vector store connectivity + basic query/add capability.

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_002_vector_store_health_endpoint.md`

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-003_RAG_INTEGRATION_TEST_LOOP

Goal: Add an integration test that:

- writes a memory item
- waits/forces embed completion
- queries retrieval
- asserts the memory is returned

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_003_rag_integration_test_loop.md`

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-004_UI_EMBED_FEEDBACK_MINIMAL

Goal: Add minimal UI feedback for embedding success/failure state (non-invasive).

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_004_ui_embed_feedback_minimal.md`

## Runner Protocol Notes

- Each TASK is two-phase (impl commit + docs artifact commit)
- Each task must constrain edits to its own Allowed Files list
- Campaign ends when all tasks merged and loop is verified

## CAMPAIGN_2026_01_20_002_MVP_LOOP_CLOSURE_CHATGPT_MIGRATION

CAMPAIGN-ID: CAMPAIGN-2026-01-20-002_MVP_LOOP_CLOSURE_CHATGPT_MIGRATION

## Mission

Make ChatGPT migration a clean, single-path feature:

- one canonical backend endpoint
- router actually registered
- UI refresh event after success
- E2E test covering the loop

## Definition of Done

✅ Upload conversations.json imports threads/messages reliably  
✅ Imported threads appear without manual refresh (event-driven)  
✅ No duplicate endpoint drift  
✅ E2E coverage exists and runs green

## Task List (execute in order)

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-005_MIGRATION_ENDPOINT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH

Goal: Determine which endpoint is active and make ONE canonical implementation.

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_005_migration_endpoint_source_of_truth.md`

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-006_REGISTER_MIGRATION_ROUTER

Goal: Ensure migration router is registered in the server app includes.
- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_006_register_migration_router.md`

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-007_IMPORT_REFRESH_EVENT

Goal: After successful import, dispatch a threads refresh event so sidebar updates.
- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_007_import_refresh_event.md`

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-008_MIGRATION_E2E_TEST

Goal: Add E2E coverage for the ChatGPT migration flow.
- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_008_migration_e2e_test.md`

The test should validate that uploading a ChatGPT export triggers the canonical endpoint and results in a UI refresh (threads list updates) without manual reload.

Constraints / Requirements
- Prefer Playwright and existing test harness patterns in this repo.
- Prefer network stubbing (route interception / mocked API) over requiring a real backend/DB.
- Must validate at minimum:
  - A UI path to open the import modal exists.
  - The import request hits **POST `/api/upload-chatgpt-export`** (canonical).
  - The success path results in an observable refresh:
    - either a threads refresh signal is dispatched, **or**
    - the UI visibly updates to include at least one imported thread, **or**
    - a follow-up threads fetch occurs (verify via network interception/polling) after import resolves.
- Keep the test deterministic; avoid timing flake (use explicit waits on events/UI state; no arbitrary sleeps).
- No unrelated refactors.

Files allowed to edit (only)
- `frontend/src/tests/playwright/migration_e2e_import.spec.ts` (new)
- `playwright.config.ts` (only if required to stabilize/enable test selection)
- `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_008_migration_e2e_test.md`

Checks to run (required)
- `pnpm --dir frontend/src test`
- `pnpm --dir frontend/src lint` (warnings ok, errors not ok)
- `pnpm --dir frontend/src exec playwright test migration_e2e_import.spec.ts`

Commit mode
- Two-phase (implementation commit + finalize task artifact commit)

Commit messages
- Commit A (implementation): `TASK-2026-01-20-008_MIGRATION_E2E_TEST: add migration e2e import coverage`
- Commit B (finalize artifact): `TASK-2026-01-20-008_MIGRATION_E2E_TEST: finalize task summary`

Expected Output
- A Playwright test that passes locally under the configured harness assumptions.
- The test asserts canonical endpoint usage and an observable post-import refresh in the UI.
- Task artifact recorded with prompt verbatim, commands + results, git status confirmation, and hashes (finalize hash may be “reported in final mapping”).

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-022_TOAST_ACCESSIBILITY_ROLES

Goal: Make the desktop toast notification region accessible and reliably selectable for E2E assertions.

- Output: Toast container exposes a stable accessibility role/live region; Playwright can assert completion via role instead of brittle text.
- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_022_toast_accessibility_roles.md`
- Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-022_TOAST_ACCESSIBILITY_ROLES -> [95d23d0c, ae52d262]`

Constraints / Requirements
- Add semantics only (no behavior change):
  - `role="status"`
  - `aria-live="polite"`
  - `aria-atomic="true"`
- If there is an existing error vs non-error toast distinction and it is trivial, errors may use `role="alert"` + `aria-live="assertive"`. Otherwise skip branching.
- Update the migration Playwright E2E to assert toast presence via role-based selector (e.g. `getByRole('status')`).
- No unrelated refactors.

Files allowed to edit (only)
- `frontend/src/imprint/ImprintZeroToast.tsx`
- `frontend/src/tests/playwright/migration_e2e_import.spec.ts`

- Commit B (finalize artifact): `TASK-2026-01-20-022_TOAST_ACCESSIBILITY_ROLES: finalize task summary`

Expected Output
- Toast container is a proper ARIA live region.
- Migration E2E uses role-based toast assertion and remains deterministic.
- Task artifact recorded with prompt verbatim, commands + results, git status confirmation, and hashes.

- Task artifact recorded with prompt verbatim, commands + results, clean git status, and hashes.


### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-011_DOCUMENT_CHUNKING_STRATEGY_MINIMAL

Goal: Implement pragmatic chunking (fixed-size + overlap) for long documents so embeddings are stable and retrieval is useful.

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_011_document_chunking_strategy_minimal.md`
    - Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-011_DOCUMENT_CHUNKING_STRATEGY_MINIMAL -> [951e32f0, 811f3777]`

Constraints / Requirements
- Chunking must be deterministic and stable for the same input text.
- Use a simple fixed-size character window with overlap (no semantic chunking required).
- Define conservative defaults (e.g., `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`) and make them easy to tune.
- Only chunk when `parsed_text` exceeds a threshold (e.g., `> chunk_size`), otherwise store a single chunk.
- Preserve ordering (each chunk should carry an index).
- Do not break existing upload flows.
- No unrelated refactors.

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-012_DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_RETRIEVAL_TEST

Goal: Add a deterministic test proving upload → parse → chunk → embed → retrieve for an uploaded document.

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_012_document_upload_retrieval_test.md`
- Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-012_DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_RETRIEVAL_TEST -> [ea1b57bd, reported in final mapping]`

Constraints / Requirements
- The test must be deterministic and should not require external services.
- Prefer stubbing/mocking embedding + vector store where possible.
- The test should validate end-to-end logic at the Guardian layer:
  1) Upload a small PDF or DOCX fixture via the active upload pipeline.
  2) Confirm `parsed_text` is populated.
  3) If chunking is enabled for the document length, confirm chunks were produced deterministically.
  4) Simulate embedding/storage for chunks.
  5) Query retrieval and assert the uploaded content is returned.
- Avoid relying on timing sleeps; use explicit awaits/polling on in-process state.
- No unrelated refactors.

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-016_DOCUMENT_GEN_OPEN_IN_EDITOR

Goal: After generation, navigate/open editor with generated doc.

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_016_document_gen_open_in_editor.md`
- Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-016_DOCUMENT_GEN_OPEN_IN_EDITOR -> [e2c7dd75, 253b049e]`

Constraints / Requirements
- After a successful generation request (TASK-014) and persistence/linking (TASK-015), the UI must navigate/open the existing document editor view with the generated document loaded.
- Use the persisted document identifier returned by the generate endpoint (e.g., `document_id`) to open the editor.
- Keep UI changes minimal and focused: wiring + navigation only (no styling refactors).
- Do not introduce new editor UX; reuse the existing editor route/component.
- If the editor route/component lives outside the allowed files list below, STOP and report the exact path(s) required so the campaign can be updated.

- Commit B (finalize artifact): `TASK-2026-01-20-016_DOCUMENT_GEN_OPEN_IN_EDITOR: finalize task summary`

Expected Output
- After generation, the editor opens with the generated document content loaded.
- A focused UI test asserts navigation/open behavior deterministically.
- Task artifact recorded with prompt verbatim, commands + results, clean git status, and hashes.

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-017_DOCUMENT_GEN_TEST

Goal: Add a deterministic test for generation logic (mock LLM).

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_017_document_gen_test.md`
- Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-017_DOCUMENT_GEN_TEST -> [50f98b5a, 98709f0c]`

Constraints / Requirements
- Add deterministic automated coverage for the document generation pipeline using an LLM stub/mock (no external network calls).
- Cover at minimum:
  - happy path: generate -> returns content -> persists document -> links to thread
  - error path: LLM failure OR DB failure returns a user-safe error
- Prefer a backend test at the Guardian layer (FastAPI test client) and stub the LLM call via dependency injection or monkeypatch.
- No unrelated refactors.

## CAMPAIGN_2026_01_20_005_PRODUCTION_GRADE_DOCKER_E2E_HARNESS

CAMPAIGN-ID: CAMPAIGN-2026-01-20-005_PRODUCTION_GRADE_DOCKER_E2E_HARNESS

## Mission

Create a reliable Docker-based Playwright E2E harness that:

- works consistently in container environments
- doesn’t fight Alpine/musl incompatibilities
- supports reuseExistingServer + explicit baseURL control
- properly ignores artifacts without polluting git

## Definition of Done

✅ `docker compose run --rm e2e pnpm --dir frontend/src exec playwright test` works  
✅ No port collisions / clear reuseExistingServer strategy  
✅ Base URL is correct inside container network  
✅ Playwright artifacts are gitignored (or directed to ignored paths)  
✅ Local non-docker Playwright path still works

## Task List (execute in order)

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-018_E2E_SERVICE_PLAYWRIGHT_OFFICIAL_IMAGE

Goal: Introduce/repair a docker-compose e2e service using Playwright’s official image
and a stable working dir/volumes pattern.

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_018_e2e_service_playwright_official_image.md`
- Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-018_E2E_SERVICE_PLAYWRIGHT_OFFICIAL_IMAGE -> [6fa78eb5, 77bb25aa]`

Constraints / Requirements
- Add or repair a docker-compose service (e.g., `e2e`) that runs Playwright tests using the official Playwright image.
- Ensure stable working directory + volume mounts so `frontend/src` tests can run.
- Ensure baseURL and networking work inside Docker (no localhost confusion).
- Do not break local non-docker Playwright usage.

Files allowed to edit (only)
- `docker-compose.yml` (or the existing compose file used by the repo)
- `frontend/src/playwright.config.ts`
- `frontend/src/package.json` (only if required for a stable script)
- `.dockerignore` (only if required)
- `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_018_e2e_service_playwright_official_image.md`
- `docs/Campaign/CAMPAIGN_2026_01_20.md`

Checks to run (required)
- `docker compose run --rm e2e pnpm --dir frontend/src exec playwright test --list`

Commit mode
- Two-phase

Commit messages
- Commit A: `TASK-2026-01-20-018_E2E_SERVICE_PLAYWRIGHT_OFFICIAL_IMAGE: add docker e2e service`
- Commit B: `TASK-2026-01-20-018_E2E_SERVICE_PLAYWRIGHT_OFFICIAL_IMAGE: finalize task summary`

Expected Output
- `docker compose run --rm e2e ... playwright test --list` succeeds inside the container.
- Task artifact recorded with commands + results + hashes.

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-019_PLAYWRIGHT_CONFIG_ENV_SWITCHING

Goal: Update playwright.config.ts so:

- baseURL uses PW_BASE_URL
- reuseExistingServer is configurable
- webServer is optional via PW_START_WEBSERVER
- local path remains valid

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_019_playwright_config_env_switching.md`
- Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-019_PLAYWRIGHT_CONFIG_ENV_SWITCHING -> [e9fc445a, 2b089206]`

Constraints / Requirements
- Update Playwright config so:
  - `baseURL` can be overridden via `PW_BASE_URL`.
  - `reuseExistingServer` can be configured via env.
  - `webServer` can be disabled via `PW_START_WEBSERVER=0`.
  - Local dev path remains valid.
- Keep changes minimal and backwards compatible.

Files allowed to edit (only)
- `frontend/src/playwright.config.ts`
- `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_019_playwright_config_env_switching.md`

- Task artifact recorded with commands + results + hashes.

### ✅ TASK-2026-01-20-020_GITIGNORE_E2E_ARTIFACTS

Goal: Ignore Playwright artifacts (test-results/, screenshots/, traces/)
OR redirect output to a known ignored directory.

- Task artifact: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_020_gitignore_e2e_artifacts.md`
- Task mapping: `TASK-2026-01-20-020_GITIGNORE_E2E_ARTIFACTS -> [9f445e63, 556bedd5]`

Constraints / Requirements
- Ensure Playwright artifacts do not pollute git:
  - ignore `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, screenshots, traces, and any `.last-run.json` or similar.
- Prefer `.gitignore` updates; alternatively redirect output into an already-ignored directory.
- No unrelated ignore changes.
