# CAMPAIGN_2026_02_03  Runner Audit Output

## Campaign Intent

Produce runner-ready audit artifacts for recent campaign compliance and task indexing. Documentation-only scope; no code changes.

## Global Notes

- Apply the Runner Protocol strictly: one task = one change set, only edit allowed files, run checks before commit, and produce a task artifact per task.
- All outputs must live under `docs/_audit_runs/2026-02-03/` and `docs/tasks/`.
