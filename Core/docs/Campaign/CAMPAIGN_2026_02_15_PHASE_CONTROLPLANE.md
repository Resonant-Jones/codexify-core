Alright. Saddle up. 🤠
We’re not writing dreams anymore — we’re writing an execution lattice.

You asked to:

* Turn this into a **Campaign Runner Index**
* Generate **Codexify Task Prompts**
* Use your surfaced context
* Treat the uploaded docs as templates only
* Not reuse their internal example data

Good. That means we design a clean Phase-Next campaign focused on:

* Memory architecture separation (IDDB)
* Flow system hardening + sandboxing
* CLI surface expansion
* Agent-operable app primitives
* Secure pre-authenticated flows
* Prompt assembly architecture (imprint/persona/system docs)
* Event Graph + Playbook alignment
* Token cost awareness + UI transparency

We are now entering the **Control Plane Phase**.

# 🧭 CAMPAIGN RUNNER INDEX

## CAMPAIGN-2026-02-Phase-ControlPlane

**Repo:** Codexify
**Goal:** Transition from conceptual architecture to enforceable runtime boundaries
**Branch Strategy:** One atomic branch per task
**Runner Protocol:** Codexify Task Template (strict)

---

## 🎯 Definition of Done

* Guardian can operate app primitives safely.
* Flows are pre-authenticated and non-interruptible.
* IDDB layers are enforced at storage boundary.
* Persona + Imprint system is persistent.
* CLI surface is sandboxed per project root.
* System prompt assembly is modular + token-aware.
* Event Graph emits traceable lineage events.
* No sensitive data can be exfiltrated via imported flows.

---

# 🗂️ TASK SEQUENCE OVERVIEW

We’ll break this into 8 atomic execution tasks.

Each below includes:

* Strategic intent
* Codexify Task Prompt (ready for automation)

---

# 🧱 TASK 1 — IDDB Layer Enforcement

## Objective

Separate:

* Diary (chat history)
* Light Imprint
* Deep Identity (optional)
* Persona overlays

Enforce modeling exclusion flags.

---

## Codexify Task Prompt

```
Context:
You’re operating on the local Codexify repo. Each task must be self-contained, testable, and committed individually.

Instructions:
1. Implement identity layer separation in backend storage:
   - Add explicit modeling_excluded flag to chat_threads.
   - Add identity_depth enum to users or projects (light | deep).
   - Add diary_mode boolean to threads.
2. Ensure diary_mode threads are excluded from identity modeling logic.
3. Update memory ingestion pipeline to respect these flags.
4. Add tests verifying:
   - Diary threads never update imprint.
   - Deep modeling only runs if identity_depth == deep.
5. Run backend tests.
6. Commit atomically.

Output:
- Summary of files changed.
- Test results.
- Commit hash.
```

# 🔐 TASK 2 — Flow Authentication Boundary

## Objective

Flows must:

* Be pre-authenticated
* Not allow mid-flow auth injection
* Require explicit user confirmation for external URLs

---

## Codexify Task Prompt

```
Context:
You’re operating on the local Codexify repo. Each task must be self-contained, testable, and committed individually.

# 🏁 Final Structure

This campaign:

* Hardens identity modeling boundaries.
* Locks flow exfiltration.
* Introduces sandbox CLI safety.
* Modularizes system prompts.
* Adds persona persistence.

You’re holding the control plane.

# CAMPAIGN-2026-02-15_PHASE_CONTROLPLANE

## Metadata
- Campaign-ID: CAMPAIGN-2026-02-15_PHASE_CONTROLPLANE
- Repo: /Users/resonant_jones/Keep/Resonant_Constructs/Codexify
- Branch: <BASE_BRANCH_NAME>
- Baseline commit (HEAD at campaign start): <BASELINE_COMMIT_HASH>
- Runner Protocol: Runner_Protocol.md
- Constraints:
  - Manual commits required (index.lock may block git add/commit in Runner env)
  - Two-phase commit per task:
    - Commit A = implementation/test/config
    - Commit B = docs finalize (campaign mapping update only)
  - DO NOT create new campaign/task directories for this campaign.
  - Task artifacts already exist; update/append those files in place.

## Goal
Implement enforceable runtime boundaries for the Control Plane phase:
- Memory architecture separation (IDDB) with modeling exclusion.
- Flow execution hardening (pre-auth only; no mid-flow auth injection).
- CLI sandboxing per project root.
- Modular system prompt assembly with token estimation.
- Persistent imprint/persona storage with precedence rules.
- Event graph emission with lineage.
- Codex entry lineage enforcement.
- Token cost UI transparency.

## Definition of Done
- Guardian can operate app primitives safely.
- Flows are pre-authenticated and non-interruptible.
- IDDB layers are enforced at the storage boundary (diary excluded from modeling).
- Persona + Imprint are persistent and precedence is deterministic.
- CLI surface is sandboxed per project root.
- System prompt assembly is modular and token-aware.
- Event Graph emits traceable lineage events.
- Imported/installed flows cannot exfiltrate sensitive data.
