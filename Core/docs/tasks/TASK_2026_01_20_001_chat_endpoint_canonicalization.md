Codexify Task Prompt

TASK-ID
TASK-2026-01-20-001_CHAT_ENDPOINT_CANONICALIZATION

Context
You’re operating on the local Codexify repo on branch chore/post-skip-hook-fixes.

We have drift/ambiguity around “the chat endpoint” (backend route(s) and frontend client calls). This causes:

- Multiple URLs that “kind of work” depending on which UI surface calls them
- Confusing proxy/baseURL behavior (especially in Docker vs local)
- Higher chance of regressions (tests/e2e hitting the wrong route)

We want ONE canonical chat endpoint that the frontend uses consistently, while preserving backward compatibility for any legacy paths.

Objective
Canonicalize the Guardian chat/completions endpoint(s):

1) Pick a single canonical backend route for chat completion.
2) Ensure any legacy/alternate routes remain functional by delegating to the canonical handler (no breaking change).
3) Update the frontend client code to call ONLY the canonical route.
4) Add/adjust tests so the canonical path is covered and legacy aliases don’t silently break.

Requirements

- Canonical route must be clearly defined and documented in the task artifact.
- Backward compatible:
  - If old route(s) exist, keep them as aliases that call the canonical handler (no duplicate logic).
  - Do NOT break existing UI flows or imports.
- Minimal behavior change:
  - No model logic changes, no prompt changes, no RAG logic changes.
  - Only routing + client path canonicalization.
- Follow docs/Ops/Runner_Protocol.md two-phase commit pattern:
  - Commit A: implementation changes only
  - Commit B: docs task artifact only
  - Include TASK-ID in BOTH commit messages.
- Commit hash paradox handling:
  - DO NOT use git commit --amend.
  - In the artifact doc, Finalize-artifact hash may be: (reported in final mapping)
  - Final output MUST include mapping with both hashes.

Files allowed to edit (only)
Backend (routing only):

- guardian/guardian_api.py (canonical backend entrypoint; router registration happens here)
- guardian/server/app.py (only if the running server for your environment uses this entrypoint)
- guardian/routes/chat.py
- guardian/routes/__init__.py (only if required for router exports; avoid if not necessary)

Frontend (client path only):

- frontend/src/lib/api.ts
- frontend/src/features/chat/GuardianChat.tsx (only if it directly hardcodes endpoints)
- frontend/src/features/chat/useChat.ts (or equivalent hook calling the chat endpoint)

Docs:

- docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_001_chat_endpoint_canonicalization.md

STOP CONDITION (scope integrity)
If any of the above paths do not exist in your checkout, STOP and report:

- the closest matching file paths you found
- what route(s) currently exist
- what the frontend currently calls
Do NOT edit “equivalent” files unless they are explicitly confirmed by the repository structure (report first).

Implementation Notes
A) Identify current routes

- Find all backend routes that serve chat completion (search for: "/chat", "/guardian", "completion", "messages", "threads", "respond", "stream").
- Find all frontend calls that send messages to the backend (search for axios.post/fetch to "/chat", "/api/chat", "/api/guardian", etc).

B) Choose canonical endpoint

- Canonical endpoint should be stable and unsurprising.
- Recommendation unless repo conventions say otherwise:
  - Canonical: POST /api/chat
- If repo already uses a different stable prefix (e.g. /api/guardian/chat), follow repo convention and make THAT canonical instead.

C) Canonical backend implementation pattern

- The canonical route should call the existing “real” handler function (or become the real handler).
- Any legacy endpoints should delegate to the canonical handler function (same request/response behavior).
- Avoid redirect responses for POST APIs (redirects break some clients). Prefer in-process delegation.

D) Frontend canonicalization

- Update the frontend to call ONLY the canonical route.
- Ensure baseURL/proxy usage remains unchanged (don’t change Vite proxy behavior in this task).

E) Tests

- Add/adjust at least one test that exercises the canonical endpoint path end-to-end at the “request layer” you already have.
- If existing tests cover chat flow but use a legacy path, update them to use canonical.
- If backend tests are sparse, add a lightweight unit/integration test for the router path mapping (canonical + alias calling same handler).

Checks to run (required)
1) Backend

- pytest -v

2) Frontend

- pnpm --dir frontend/src test
- pnpm --dir frontend/src lint

3) Final repo state

- git status --porcelain  (must be empty after Commit B)

Git steps (two-phase)

Commit A (implementation)

1) git status --porcelain (must show only expected changes)
2) Run required checks above (must pass)
3) git add <only allowed files that changed>
4) git commit -m "TASK-2026-01-20-001_CHAT_ENDPOINT_CANONICALIZATION: canonicalize chat endpoint + alias legacy routes"
5) Capture hash A

Commit B (finalize task artifact)

1) Create/update docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_001_chat_endpoint_canonicalization.md including:
   - Task Prompt (verbatim copy of this prompt)
   - What is the canonical endpoint (exact path + method)
   - What legacy endpoints exist and how they alias
   - Summary: files changed, commands run + results, git status confirmation
   - Commit mode: two-phase (NO amend)
   - Implementation hash: <hash A>
   - Finalize-artifact hash: (reported in final mapping)
2) git add docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_001_chat_endpoint_canonicalization.md
3) git commit -m "TASK-2026-01-20-001_CHAT_ENDPOINT_CANONICALIZATION: finalize task summary"
4) Capture hash B

Output required (must print)

- Canonical endpoint (method + path)
- Legacy endpoints and alias behavior
- Commands run + pass/fail
- git status --porcelain (must be empty)
- Mapping:
  TASK-2026-01-20-001_CHAT_ENDPOINT_CANONICALIZATION -> [<impl_hash>, <finalize_hash>]

Acceptance Criteria
✅ Frontend calls exactly one chat endpoint path (canonical)  
✅ Backend supports canonical path + legacy aliases without duplicating logic  
✅ Tests/lint pass  
✅ Working tree clean after finalize commit

## Naming and file placement conventions

Codexify uses **dash-form IDs** and **underscore-form filenames**. This is intentional.

### Task IDs vs task filenames

- **TASK-ID format (dash form):** `TASK-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN_SLUG`
  - Example: `TASK-2026-01-20-001_CHAT_ENDPOINT_CANONICALIZATION`

- **Task prompt artifact filename (underscore form):** `docs/tasks/TASK_YYYY_MM_DD_NNN_<lowercase_slug>.md`
  - Example: `docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_001_chat_endpoint_canonicalization.md`

Rules:
- Task *filenames* always use underscores in the date and separators, and use a **lowercase** slug.
- Task *IDs* inside the file stay in dash form.

### Campaign IDs vs campaign filenames

- **CAMPAIGN-ID format (dash form):** `CAMPAIGN-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN_SLUG`
  - Example: `CAMPAIGN-2026-01-20-001_MVP_LOOP_CLOSURE_RAG`

- **Campaign stack filename (underscore form):** `docs/Campaign/CAMPAIGN_YYYY_MM_DD.md`
  - Example: `docs/Campaign/CAMPAIGN_2026_01_20.md`

Rules:
- Campaign files live under `docs/Campaign/` (capital C).
- Campaign filenames use underscores and include the date; the active campaign is selected **inside** the file by CAMPAIGN-ID.

### Untracked vs tracked renames

- If a file is **untracked** and needs to be renamed to match conventions, use:
  - `mv <old> <new>`
  - then `git add <new>`

- If a file is **already tracked**, use:
  - `git mv <old> <new>`

This avoids the common failure mode where `git mv` is attempted on an untracked file.

### Shell command hygiene

When copy/pasting commands, use ASCII hyphens:
- ✅ `git status --porcelain`
- ❌ `git status –porcelain` (en-dash)

The en-dash version will break in shells and can create confusing false negatives.

## Summary

Canonical endpoint:
- POST /api/chat/{thread_id}/complete (canonical base: /api/chat)

Legacy endpoints and alias behavior:
- /chat/* remains available and routes to the same handler functions.
- /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/{thread_id}/latest aliases /chat/debug/rag-trace/{thread_id}/latest.

Changes:
- guardian/routes/chat.py: mark /api/chat as canonical and add the debug alias.
- frontend/src/lib/api.ts: normalize /api prefix when baseURL already ends with /api.
- frontend/src/features/chat/GuardianChat.tsx: switch hardcoded chat calls to /chat.

Tests:
- pytest -v (pass)
- pnpm --dir frontend/src test (pass)
- pnpm --dir frontend/src lint (pass with warnings: existing lint warnings)

git status --porcelain:
- docs/tasks/TASK_2026_01_20_001_chat_endpoint_canonicalization.md
