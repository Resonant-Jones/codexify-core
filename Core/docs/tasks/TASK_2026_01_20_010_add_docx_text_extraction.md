# TASK-2026-01-20-010_ADD_DOCX_TEXT_EXTRACTION: Add DOCX text extraction

## Task Prompt
### Context
You are operating in the Codexify repo to extend the document upload pipeline for the
`CAMPAIGN-2026-01-20-003_MVP_LOOP_CLOSURE_DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_PARSING` campaign.

### Instructions
1. Implement DOCX text extraction using a server-side library.
2. Populate `parsed_text` for uploaded DOCX files and handle failures gracefully.
3. Keep scope limited to the allowed files and run `pytest -v`.
4. Use two-phase commits with the provided commit messages.

### Task Description
Goal: Add a DOCX parsing library and extraction path in the upload pipeline.

Constraints / Requirements
- Prefer a backend DOCX text extraction library suitable for server-side use.
- Populate `parsed_text` for uploaded DOCX files so they become searchable knowledge.
- Keep extraction pragmatic (plain text is fine; styling/layout fidelity is not required).
- Handle empty/failed extraction gracefully with a clear error message and without crashing the upload flow.
- No unrelated refactors.

### Expected Output
- Uploaded DOCX files have `parsed_text` populated.
- A focused test proves DOCX text extraction works.
- Task artifact recorded with prompt verbatim, commands + results, clean git status, and hashes.
