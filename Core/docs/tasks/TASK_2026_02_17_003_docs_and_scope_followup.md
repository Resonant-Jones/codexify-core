# CAMPAIGN_2026_02_17_DOCS_AND_SCOPE_FOLLOWUP

## Campaign Metadata
- campaign_id: CAMPAIGN_2026_02_17_DOCS_AND_SCOPE_FOLLOWUP
- campaign_slug: docs-and-scope-followup
- campaign_doc_path: docs/Campaign/<RUNNER_DETERMINES>.md
- source_findings: FINDING-2026-02-17-009, FINDING-2026-02-17-011
- objective: Remove stale canonical-roadmap ambiguity and keep deferred image-provider scope explicitly documented as MVP-non-blocking.

## Tasks

### Task 001
- task_id: 001
- task_title: Decision task - archive stale canonical roadmap and point to maintained source of truth
- risk: MED
- task_artifact_path: docs/tasks/<RUNNER_DETERMINES>.md
- allowed_files:
  - docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap.md
- command_checklist:
  1. Preflight: git status --porcelain -uall must be empty
  2. test -z "$(git status --porcelain -uall)" || { echo "STOP: dirty tree"; echo "Cleanup: git stash push -u -m preflight-CAMPAIGN_2026_02_17_DOCS_AND_SCOPE_FOLLOWUP-001"; exit 1; }
  3. rg -n "Date:|NOT registered|PDF|DOCX" docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap.md
  4. violations="$(git diff --name-only | rg -v '^(docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap\\.md)$' || true)"; test -z "$violations" || { echo "STOP: out-of-scope files detected"; printf '%s\n' "$violations"; echo "Cleanup: git restore --staged $violations && git restore $violations"; exit 1; }
  5. rg -n "Status: Archived|Superseded by docs/reports/mvp-core-loop-closure-matrix.md" docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap.md
  6. if rg -n "NOT registered|missing migration router|PDF parsing gap|DOCX parsing gap" docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap.md; then echo "STOP: stale contradictory claims remain"; exit 1; fi
- expected_outputs:
  - roadmap clearly marked archived with explicit superseding source
  - stale contradictory implementation claims removed or clearly historical/non-authoritative
  - no out-of-scope files are modified
- rollback_commands:
  - git restore docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap.md
- dependencies:
  - command -v rg >/dev/null

### Task 002
- task_id: 002
- task_title: Reassert deferred non-OpenAI image providers as MVP-acceptable in README and env template
- risk: LOW
- task_artifact_path: docs/tasks/<RUNNER_DETERMINES>.md
- allowed_files:
  - README.md
  - .env.template
- command_checklist:
  1. Preflight: git status --porcelain -uall must be empty
  2. test -z "$(git status --porcelain -uall)" || { echo "STOP: dirty tree"; echo "Cleanup: git stash push -u -m preflight-CAMPAIGN_2026_02_17_DOCS_AND_SCOPE_FOLLOWUP-002"; exit 1; }
  3. rg -n "not implemented|IMAGE_GEN_PROVIDER" guardian/image_gen/providers/local.py guardian/image_gen/providers/stability.py README.md .env.template
  4. violations="$(git diff --name-only | rg -v '^(README\\.md|\\.env\\.template)$' || true)"; test -z "$violations" || { echo "STOP: out-of-scope files detected"; printf '%s\n' "$violations"; echo "Cleanup: git restore --staged $violations && git restore $violations"; exit 1; }
  5. rg -n "MVP|deferred|503|IMAGE_GEN_PROVIDER" README.md .env.template
- expected_outputs:
  - README and .env.template explicitly state local/stability providers are deferred and may return 503
  - scope statement is consistent with MVP decision and does not mark deferred providers as blockers
  - no out-of-scope files are modified
- rollback_commands:
  - git restore README.md .env.template
- dependencies:
  - command -v rg >/dev/null

# Codexify MVP Roadmap & Core Loop Plan

**Document Version:** 2.0 (Complete Codebase Audit)
**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Author:** Technical Product Lead + Staff Engineer Audit (Claude Code)
**Scope:** MVP Feature Completeness Analysis & Implementation Plan

---

## 1. Overview & Goals

### 1.1 Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the Codexify codebase against the six core MVP features, identifies implementation gaps, and defines a concrete roadmap to achieve a fully operational MVP.

**Current Status:** Codexify is **75-85% complete** at MVP level. Most core infrastructure is production-ready, but several critical integration gaps prevent end-to-end workflows from being fully operational.

**Primary Objective:** Close all core feature loops to enable immediate dogfooding and production use.

# Codexify MVP Roadmap (Archived)

Status: Archived
Decision Date: 2026-02-17
Decision: This document is archived as a planning source and is no longer authoritative for MVP scope or implementation status.
Superseded by docs/reports/mvp-core-loop-closure-matrix.md

## Decision Record

This is an explicit scope and documentation decision made on 2026-02-17:
- The former roadmap content in this file is treated as historical audit material only.
- Current MVP closure and loop status must be read from "'`docs/reports/mvp-core-loop-closure-matrix.md`.
- Any discrepancy between this file'"'s prior contents and current implementation should be resolved in favor of the superseding report and current code.

## Historical Retrieval

If historical audit detail from the prior version is needed, recover it from Git history for this path:
- "'`git log -- docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap.md`
- `git show <commit>:docs/codexify-mvp-roadmap.md`

**Profiled containers (not started unless enabled)**
- `chatgpt-migrate` (`cli` profile)
- `embedding-backfill`, `graph-backfill` (`backfill` profile)

**Communication summary**
- Backend <-> Postgres (chat threads, messages, memory, outbox, documents, media, etc.)
- Backend <-> Redis (task queues + task event streams)
- Backend <-> Neo4j (only if graph flags enabled)
- Backend <-> Vector store (FAISS/Chroma using local embeddings)
- Frontend <-> Backend (Vite proxy injects `X-API-Key` automatically in dev)

**Startup sequence (Compose)**
1. Postgres + Neo4j start
2. `graph-init` applies constraints (requires `NEO4J_PASS`)
3. `migrator` runs Alembic + `seed_defaults.py`
4. Backend starts, verifies required tables, seeds defaults again, then serves API
5. Workers start (Redis required)

## Repo Structure (Truthful)
 succeeded in 51ms:
# .env.template / .env.example
# Local-only environment configuration. Copy to .env and edit.
# Never commit your real .env. Templates are the source of truth.
#
# Security hygiene:
# - .env is ignored via .gitignore: keep it local-only.
# - Rotate GUARDIAN_API_KEY regularly; prefer short-lived tokens.
# - Never ship VITE_GUARDIAN_API_KEY in any hosted/public build.

# --- Core runtime ---
ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DEBUG=true
PORT=8000

# --- Auth boundary ---
# local  -> static X-API-Key auth is allowed (localhost/dev only)
# remote -> static API keys are rejected; session/JWT is required
GUARDIAN_AUTH_MODE=local
# Backend auth secret. Use a long random value and rotate frequently.

Sensitive or architectural areas:
- `guardian/core/` (auth, DB wiring, event bus)
- `guardian/core/config.py` (provider routing rules)
- `guardian/guardian_api.py` (app lifecycle + router wiring)

Safe changes:
- UI components and styling in `frontend/src`
- New API endpoints in `guardian/routes/`
- New migrations under `guardian/db/migrations/versions/`

If you're unsure, open a small PR touching one area (UI or a single route) and ask for guidance.

### Known foot-guns

- Backend exits if `GUARDIAN_API_KEY` is missing.
* `LOCAL_EMBED_MODEL` must be **absolute** or embeddings will fail.
* Default templates use `http://localhost:11434/v1` for `LOCAL_BASE_URL`; update it for Docker (e.g., `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1`) or your local setup.
* `make dev` runs `guardian.system_init` (not the FastAPI API server).

# Codexify

Codexify is a local-first chat + knowledge workspace built around a FastAPI backend (Guardian) and a React UI. It provides thread-based chat, memory silos, document autosave and sharing, media uploads, vector search, and optional workers for background tasks. Docker Compose is the primary, supported way to run the full stack.

### TL;DR — Start Here

If you want to **run Codexify locally** with the least friction:

* Use **Docker Compose**
* Copy `.env.template → .env`
* `.env` is local-only; never commit it (templates are the source of truth)
* Set `GUARDIAN_API_KEY`, `NEO4J_PASS`, and your local LLM settings
* Run: `docker compose up --build`
* Open:

  * UI: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
  * API docs: [http://localhost:8888/docs](http://localhost:8888/docs)

If you want to **contribute code**, start with:

 succeeded in 52ms:
- `make test` runs `python -m pytest -q guardian/tests tests` and will prompt if pytest is missing.
- You can also run pytest directly:

```bash
pytest guardian/tests
pytest tests
```

### Migrations
- Alembic config: `backend/alembic.ini`
- Migrations live in `guardian/db/migrations/`

```bash
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini revision -m "your change"
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

### Known foot-guns
- Backend exits if `GUARDIAN_API_KEY` is missing.
- `LOCAL_EMBED_MODEL` must be **absolute** or embeddings will fail.

**Clarifying image provider messaging**
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "sed -n '255,290p' README.md" in /Users/resonant_jones/Keep/Resonant_Constructs/Codexify succeeded in 52ms:
- `NEO4J_PASS` - required by `graph-init` (Compose dependency).
- `LOCAL_BASE_URL` - OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint (e.g., Ollama).
- `LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` - model name passed to the local endpoint.
- `LOCAL_EMBED_MODEL` - **absolute path inside container** (e.g., `/models/bge-large-en-v1.5`).

### Required if running without Docker
- `DATABASE_URL` (or `GUARDIAN_DATABASE_URL`) - no DB, no chat/memory persistence.

### Common optional settings
- Cloud LLM usage requires all of:
  - `ALLOW_CLOUD_PROVIDERS=true`
  - `CODEXIFY_LOCAL_ONLY_MODE=false`
  - `CODEXIFY_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST=openai` (or `groq`)
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or `GROQ_API_KEY`)
- `CODEXIFY_VECTOR_STORE=chroma|faiss`
- `CODEXIFY_ALLOW_EMBEDDINGS_FALLBACK=1` (allow mock embeddings fallback and `/api/embeddings` dummy mode)
- `EMBEDDING_BACKEND=dummy|gpt_oss|nomic` (`stub` is accepted as an alias for `dummy`)
- `GUARDIAN_ENABLE_GRAPH_CONTEXT=true` / `GUARDIAN_ENABLE_GRAPH_LOGGING=true`
- `ENABLE_CONNECTOR_WORKER=true` (and provider tokens like `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- `IMAGE_GEN_PROVIDER` + `IMAGE_GEN_MODEL` (image generation)
