## Provider Governance and Beta Operator Workflow

### Governance model

- `guardian/core/provider_registry.py` is the canonical source of truth for provider authorization, availability, and capability decisions. Catalog, health, router, and worker paths are expected to agree with it.
- `config/supported_profiles/v1-local-core-web-mcp.yaml` is the beta release contract for the current supported local-first provider posture. `/health` exposes the active supported-profile state during runtime.
- `/api/llm/catalog` is the discovered inventory surface. It shows provider/model entries and policy-shaped availability state; `?include=all` is the operator view when hidden or unauthorized providers need inspection.
- `/health/llm` is the active-provider runtime surface. It reports the currently selected provider, provider-runtime status, and queue-backed completion-service health for that live runtime.
- `/health/chat` is the queue/worker surface. It is the quickest confirmation that Redis, enqueue, and worker heartbeat are healthy for chat completion.

### Why operators should read registry, health, and catalog together

- Catalog answers “what inventory does the runtime currently describe?”
- Health answers “is the currently selected execution path reachable and are chat workers alive?”
- The supported profile and provider registry answer “what should be allowed and treated as supported for this beta?”
- None of those surfaces is sufficient alone. A green health check does not prove the mounted route surface matches the supported profile, and catalog presence does not prove that a provider path is part of the supported beta contract.

### Provider governance note

- The supported profile file is the beta release contract. It is the posture that the runtime must satisfy, not a loose hint about preferred defaults.
- Catalog discovery is not support. A provider can be discovered, authorized, or even executable at a runtime layer without being part of the supported beta posture.
- Provider health is not support by itself. `/health`, `/health/chat`, and `/api/health/llm` must be read alongside `/api/llm/catalog` to understand the actual beta posture.
- Cloud-capable configuration must always be interpreted against the active supported-profile posture. If the profile is local-only, cloud-capable env flags or credentials are drift evidence, not beta approval.
- For release proof, `/health`, `/api/health/llm`, and `/api/llm/catalog` should agree on the supported profile, the selected provider, and whether the runtime is release-hold or aligned.
- Operator views such as `?include=all` may still show unsupported providers for diagnosis, but that inspection surface does not widen release support.
- Default catalog and health truth should keep discovered inventory, configured provider, egress-allowed provider, supported-profile-approved provider, and executable provider distinct so operators can see exactly where posture diverges.

### Current operator limits without a full Command Center / Observability Deck

- Operators can currently infer whether the selected provider is configured, credentialed, egress-allowed, and reachable enough for the active runtime path.
- Operators can currently infer whether discovered provider inventory is available, disabled, or filtered with a reason.
- Operators can currently infer whether the chat completion service is degraded because Redis is unreachable, enqueue is failing, or worker heartbeat is missing.
- Operators cannot yet rely on a single integrated surface to explain every routing decision, provider downgrade, discovery mismatch, or queue-to-UI causal chain.
- Operators cannot treat partial operator UI components as the supported beta source of truth. The repo contains internal/operator-facing UI work, but the Command Center / Observability Deck is not the released beta operator surface and should not be assumed to live in the main shell navigation.

### Current dev-only and internal operational surfaces

- `/debug/rag-trace/{thread_id}/latest` is explicitly dev-only. It reads the latest completion trace from task events when available, falls back to in-memory cache, and is cleared by restart.
- In the current supported profile, `command_bus` is marked internal-only. That route posture is an operator/runtime concern, not an end-user release surface.
- Partial action-center style UI exists in the frontend codebase, but its backing data sources depend on routes and operational surfaces that are not the primary supported beta workflow.

### Expected source of truth during beta operation

| Question | Current source of truth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Which provider posture is supported for this beta? | `config/supported_profiles/v1-local-core-web-mcp.yaml` plus `GET /health` | Use this before trusting broader route or provider availability claims. |
| Which providers/models are currently discoverable and policy-shaped? | `GET /api/llm/catalog` | Use `?include=all` for operator debugging when filtered providers matter. |
| Is the active provider path actually available right now? | `GET /health/llm` | Read `provider_runtime` together with completion-service status. |
| Is chat execution degraded because of queue or worker issues? | `GET /health/chat` | This is the fastest signal for Redis reachability, enqueue health, and worker heartbeat. |
| How should routing validation be done? | Supported profile + provider registry behavior + live completion evidence | Do not infer routing correctness from shell UI presence alone. |
| What is the best current evidence for RAG trace behavior? | `GET /debug/rag-trace/{thread_id}/latest` plus task events/logs | Dev-only and non-durable; useful for live debugging, not durable release proof by itself. |

### Beta readiness operator verification workflow

1. Confirm the intended beta contract before trusting runtime signals.
   - Read `config/supported_profiles/v1-local-core-web-mcp.yaml` for the supported provider posture, internal-only extensions, and quarantined routes.
   - Treat `guardian/core/provider_registry.py` as the canonical provider-governance source and `GET /health` as the runtime read of the active supported profile.
   - Call the release `hold` if runtime profile state or mounted route posture contradicts that contract.
2. Compare discovered inventory with the live provider path.
   - Use `GET /api/llm/catalog` and `GET /api/llm/catalog?include=all` to inspect what the runtime is exposing and filtering.
   - Use `GET /health/llm` to confirm the active provider path and `GET /health/chat` to confirm Redis, enqueue, and worker heartbeat for completion.
   - Treat catalog, health, and supported-profile state as one release gate; a green health response alone is not beta proof.
3. Use current shipped operator surfaces, not partial UI, for signoff.
   - The Command Center / Observability Deck and partial action-center UI are still internal or dev-only; they are supplemental, not the released beta source of truth.
   - `/debug/rag-trace/{thread_id}/latest` is useful for live debugging, but it is still dev-only and non-durable.
   - For current beta decisions, the supported evidence pack is backend endpoints, logs, `/metrics`, and direct probes.
4. Separate backend correctness from observability completeness.
   - Strong deterministic tests plus green queue/provider health can justify a "runtime stabilizing" read.
   - They do not justify `go` if the supported-profile contract is drifting, quarantined routes are exposed, or the operator still needs ad hoc Compose/container inspection to explain the real state.
5. Manually verify the minimum beta-ready evidence before calling `go`.
   - Verify the supported-profile flags are active, internal-only/quarantined routes are not exposed on the supported beta surface, provider registry posture agrees with catalog and health, and the current audit window includes fresh live proof for assistant completion plus upload -> embed -> retrieve.
   - If any of those checks fail, or if the mismatch can only be explained through unsupported/internal surfaces, record the release as `hold`.

### Workspace proof harness for release evidence

- Use `scripts/proofs/prove_workspace_obsidian_e2e.py` when you need live evidence that a workspace-scoped completion can be influenced by an Obsidian-backed local note on the supported local Compose path.
- The harness stages a scratch vault under `tmp/`, indexes it through `/api/obsidian/config` and `/api/obsidian/index`, then waits on the real task-event stream and verifies the persisted assistant message plus retrieval posture.
- It is release evidence only. It does not prove sync automation, connector UX, packaged desktop behavior, or any non-Compose install mode.
- Exact command:

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:8888 GUARDIAN_API_KEY="$(scripts/dev/dev-key.sh)" \
python scripts/proofs/prove_workspace_obsidian_e2e.py
```

### Storage, media, and embeddings

| Variable | Current behavior | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| `CODEXIFY_VECTOR_STORE` | Selects vector backend in the general vector abstraction | `guardian/vector/store.py` |
| `CODEXIFY_CHROMA_PATH` | Local Chroma persistence path | `guardian/runtime/embed/embedder.py`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| `CODEXIFY_COLLECTION` | Chroma collection name | `guardian/runtime/embed/embedder.py` |
| storage backend envs | Storage factory can target local filesystem, S3, or GCS | `guardian/core/storage.py` |
| `GUARDIAN_MEDIA_URL_SECRET` | Signs `/media/*` URLs | `guardian/core/media_signing.py` |

### Local embed model bootstrap contract

- `guardian/scripts/ensure_embed_model.py` only reports success when the local model directory contains sentence-transformer markers (for example `modules.json`, `sentence_bert_config.json`, or `config_sentence_transformers.json`) **and** at least one weight artifact (`model.safetensors` or `pytorch_model.bin`).
- If the directory exists but is incomplete (for example tokenizer/config files or `onnx/` only), the bootstrap step removes the shell and rehydrates the model before backend/worker startup proceeds. The `.codexify_model_ok` sentinel alone is not sufficient.

### Federation, graph, and command bus

| Variable | Current behavior | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| `GUARDIAN_ENABLE_GRAPH_CONTEXT` | Enables graph snippets during context assembly | `guardian/context/broker.py`, `guardian/core/config.py` |
| `CODEXIFY_ENABLE_GRAPH_WRITES` | Master runtime gate for graph-write persistence. Defaults to `false`. When false, the graph backend factory always returns `NoopGraphBackendAdapter` regardless of `CODEXIFY_GRAPH_BACKEND` or Neo4j container presence. | `guardian/memory_graph/graph_backend_factory.py`, `guardian/core/config.py`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| `CODEXIFY_GRAPH_BACKEND` | Graph backend adapter selection. Defaults to `noop`. Valid values: `noop`, `neo4j`. Only effective when `CODEXIFY_ENABLE_GRAPH_WRITES=true`. Neo4j container presence alone does not enable graph writes. | `guardian/memory_graph/graph_backend_factory.py`, `guardian/core/config.py`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| `GUARDIAN_FEDERATION_ENABLED` | Master feature gate for federation routes | `guardian/routes/federation.py`, `guardian/core/config.py` |
| trust policy envs | Signed policy, node allowlist, and federation auth requirements are env-driven | `guardian/routes/federation.py`, `guardian/core/config.py` |
| `GUARDIAN_COMMAND_BUS_LOOPBACK_BASE` | Base URL for command bus loopback execution | `guardian/command_bus/loopback_http_adapter.py`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| WebSocket rate-limit envs | Guard `/api/ws/rpc` connection and payload behavior | `guardian/routes/websocket.py`, `guardian/core/config.py` |

#### Graph-write runtime boundary on the supported Compose path

The supported local Docker Compose path enforces a default-off contract for graph writes:

- `CODEXIFY_ENABLE_GRAPH_WRITES=false` and `CODEXIFY_GRAPH_BACKEND=noop` are explicitly wired into the `backend` and worker services in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Running `docker compose config` should visibly show these env vars on the `backend`, `worker-chat`, `worker-coding`, `worker-warmup`, and `graph-backfill` services.
- The Neo4j service may be present in the Compose topology, but its presence does not imply graph-write enablement.
- Graph-write enablement requires both flags to be explicitly set: `CODEXIFY_ENABLE_GRAPH_WRITES=true` AND `CODEXIFY_GRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j`.
- The factory in `guardian/memory_graph/graph_backend_factory.py` is fail-closed: invalid backend values, missing flags, or absent Neo4j adapter all resolve to `NoopGraphBackendAdapter`.

### Frontend and desktop runtime

| Variable | Current behavior | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_PROXY_TARGET` | Frontend dev proxy target in Compose | `docker-compose.yml` |
| desktop backend/share envs | Tauri can inject backend/share base URLs at runtime | `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`, `frontend/src/lib/runtimeConfig.ts` |
| browser-stored overrides | Desktop/web runtime can be overridden by local storage keys | `frontend/src/lib/runtimeConfig.ts` |

### Desktop first-run setup readiness

- The desktop launcher/setup wizard now classifies local first-run readiness into explicit states such as missing or incomplete config, Docker/Ollama availability, selected Ollama model availability, Compose config validity, existing Codexify volumes, backend/frontend availability, and ready.
- Native bridge failures in the desktop shell are classified separately from Docker preflight failures so browser-mode or Tauri bridge import problems do not masquerade as a missing Docker installation.
- The wizard/launcher presents the user-facing local provider posture as “Local via Ollama.”
- The machine config remains split across the legacy and canonical lanes: `AI_BACKEND=ollama` plus `LLM_PROVIDER=local`, with `LOCAL_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434` for the Docker Compose runtime.
- Users should not be asked to manually source `.env`; setup reads and writes dotenv-style config directly, and values such as `GUARDIAN_CSP_POLICY` must be preserved as valid dotenv rather than shell script syntax.
- Local backend smoke testing should start the runtime backend with `CODEXIFY_CONFIG_SOURCE=core` so the canonical local provider path can boot without a Groq key when AI inference is not being exercised.
- If someone intentionally forces `CODEXIFY_CONFIG_SOURCE=legacy`, the legacy validator still applies and `AI_BACKEND=groq` continues to require `GROQ_API_KEY`.

### Packaged launcher and runtime distribution contract

- The DMG installs `Codexify.app`, which contains the Tauri launcher, setup wizard, bundled frontend, and native command layer.
- Packaged first-run uses registry-backed Docker images for Codexify services instead of building local runtime images from source on the user’s machine.
- Source/dev installs may still use the repository Compose path and local build workflow.
- The launcher/wizard is responsible for creating local config, validating Compose, pulling the registry-backed runtime images, and starting services in the packaged path.
- Packaged first-run users should not need Rust, pnpm, Python dev tooling, or a source checkout to reach a usable local runtime.
- The backend registry image now has a compiled/frozen dispatcher target built with PyInstaller at `backend/compiled_runtime_entry.py`.
- The proof target lives in `backend/Dockerfile` as `compiled-runtime` and keeps the source-backed runtime stage intact for dev and legacy Compose paths.
- Packaged runtime now uses a single compiled dispatcher image, `codexify-runtime`, with role-specific commands such as `backend`, `migrator`, `model-prep`, and the worker roles.
- The compiled runtime ships runtime-owned Alembic config plus the migration tree under `/app/runtime` so the migrator role can run without raw `/app/backend` or `/app/guardian` source paths.
- The proof image still ships a small set of non-source runtime files needed by startup, including supported-profile YAML and bundled help content.
- Packaged desktop auth handoff now flows through a Tauri command that returns a sanitized runtime auth/config payload for the local packaged runtime. The frontend consumes the handed-off `GUARDIAN_API_KEY` only in packaged mode, while diagnostics expose only presence and source metadata such as `envPath`, `runtimeRoot`, and `failureKind`.
- The Guardian auth gate now derives from the same in-memory runtime API key that the desktop API client uses, so packaged desktop mode can satisfy local auth without `VITE_GUARDIAN_API_KEY`; the legacy Vite env key remains a dev-only fallback.
- Packaged desktop live updates use the same authenticated SSE request path as the rest of the runtime client. If the event stream disconnects while `/health/chat` and `/api/health/llm` are still green, the shell should surface that as a separate live-update transport warning rather than a provider-health degradation, and the technical details should show the observed endpoint, auth source, HTTP status or transport error class, and polling timestamps without revealing raw credentials.

## Config Resolution Order and Defaults

1. `guardian/guardian_api.py` imports `guardian.core.dependencies` and explicitly loads dotenv files through `_load_env_chain()`.
2. `_load_env_chain()` attempts to read, in order:
   - `.env`
   - `.env.backend.{GUARDIAN_ENV|development}`
   - `.env.local`
3. Each dotenv file loads with `override=False`.
   - Practical result: existing `os.environ` wins, and earlier dotenv layers can block later dotenv layers from overriding the same key.
4. `guardian/core/config.py` then materializes canonical settings through Pydantic.
5. `assert_config_coherence()` compares canonical settings against legacy settings in `guardian/config/core.py`.
6. `CODEXIFY_CONFIG_SOURCE` controls how strict that reconciliation is, with `strict` as the default in `guardian/core/config.py`.

Operational consequence:
- Config is not yet single-source. A safe config change should be checked against both `guardian/core/config.py` and `guardian/config/core.py`.

Unverified:
- The full precedence matrix across every deployment mode is not exhaustively documented in-repo; `tests/core/test_config_coherence.py` is the best current verification anchor.

## Local Dev Run Commands

### Main entry points

- Full stack with containers:
  - `docker compose up --build`
- Backend app:
  - `uvicorn guardian.guardian_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888`
- Packaged backend entrypoint:
  - `guardian-api`
- Frontend:
  - `pnpm --dir frontend/src install`
  - `pnpm --dir frontend/src dev`
- Desktop shell:
  - `make desktop-dev`
  - `make desktop-build`

### Checks and tests

- Python test suite:
  - `make test`
- Python lint/type checks:
  - `make lint`
- Frontend lint:
  - `pnpm lint`
- Frontend tests:
  - `pnpm test`
- Docs build:
  - `make docs`

## Healthchecks and Diagnostics

- `GET /ping`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /health/llm`
- `GET /health/chat`
- `GET /health/memory`
- `GET /api/llm/catalog`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /api/tasks/{task_id}/events`
- `GET /api/events`
- command bus run stream:
  - `GET /api/guardian/commands/runs/{run_id}/events`

Packaged desktop runtime banners now expose sanitized health-poll diagnostics when degraded. Operators can read the banner's resolved API base URL, auth source, endpoint paths, HTTP status or transport error class, parsed status, parsed `ok` value, and poll timestamps without exposing raw credentials. Use those fields together with terminal probes when the packaged UI appears stale or disagrees with `/health/chat` and `/api/health/llm`.

Primary anchors:
- `guardian/routes/health.py`
- `guardian/guardian_api.py`
- `guardian/routes/command_bus.py`

## Logging and Observability

- API requests get request IDs through middleware, and both HTTP and unhandled exception responses include `request_id`.
- Worker processes log with subsystem-specific prefixes and emit task lifecycle signals through Redis task events.
- `/metrics` exists and Prometheus setup is initialized during app startup.
- Command bus and websocket paths have explicit event/audit storage rather than relying only on console logs.
- Structured JSON logger setup is `Unverified`; the scanned startup path used stdlib logging plus subsystem-specific log messages.

## Workspace Obsidian E2E Proof Harness

A canonical live-proof harness exists for the `retrievalSource="workspace"` seam on the supported local Compose path. It validates the complete end-to-end path from Obsidian-backed note ingestion through queue-backed completion to retrieval-posture trace evidence.

**Script:** `scripts/proofs/prove_workspace_obsidian_e2e.py`

| Condition | What it checks | Failure class |
|---|---|---|
| Health | `/health`, `/health/chat`, `/api/health/llm` return 2xx | `HEALTH_CHECK_FAILED` (exit 2) |
| Ingest | Sentinel note accepted via `/api/obsidian/ingest` | `INGESTION_FAILED` (exit 3) |
| Acceptance | Completion request returns task_id | `ACCEPTANCE_FAILED` (exit 4) |
| Terminal state | Task reaches `task.completed` or `task.failed` | `COMPLETION_TIMEOUT` (exit 5) |
| Response verdict | Assistant response contains sentinel-derived answer | `RESPONSE_VERDICT_FAILED` (exit 6) |
| Retrieval posture | Posture snapshot shows workspace-local signal | `RETRIEVAL_EVIDENCE_FAILED` (exit 7) |

**Command:**
```bash
python scripts/proofs/prove_workspace_obsidian_e2e.py
# Or with explicit BASE and key:
BASE=http://localhost:8888 GUARDIAN_API_KEY="$(cat ~/.codex_guardian_key)" \
  python scripts/proofs/prove_workspace_obsidian_e2e.py
```
**Scope note:** This harness validates the supported local Compose path only. It does NOT prove sync automation, connector UX, or non-Compose install modes. Contract tests live at `tests/proofs/test_workspace_obsidian_e2e_contract.py`.

## Common Failure Signatures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Backend exits immediately on boot | `GUARDIAN_API_KEY` missing or config coherence failure | `guardian/guardian_api.py`, `guardian/core/config.py` |
| `POST /api/chat/{id}/complete` returns `503` | Redis unavailable or queue enqueue failure | `guardian/routes/chat.py`, `guardian/queue/redis_queue.py` |
| Completion task starts but no answer arrives | chat worker down, provider timeout, or provider connectivity issue | `guardian/workers/chat_worker.py`, `guardian/core/ai_router.py`, Compose worker logs |
| Provider appears selectable but fails at runtime | catalog/runtime mismatch for provider support | `guardian/core/llm_catalog.py`, `guardian/core/ai_router.py` |
| Document upload succeeds but never becomes searchable | parse failure, embed enqueue failure, or embed worker failure | `guardian/routes/media.py`, `guardian/workers/document_embed_worker.py` |
| Command bus run stays `blocked` | policy decision, write-lane restriction, or loopback recursion guard | `guardian/command_bus/invoke.py`, `guardian/command_bus/loopback_http_adapter.py` |
| Cron run is queued but never finishes | scheduler/worker split or Redis issue | `guardian/cron/scheduler.py`, `guardian/workers/cron_worker.py` |
| Federation endpoints reject requests with `403` or `503` | feature flag disabled, trust policy invalid, or egress disallowed | `guardian/routes/federation.py`, `guardian/core/egress.py` |
| Live UI events stop after restart | relying on process-local sync/event fanout path | `guardian/sync/bus.py`, `guardian/core/event_bus.py` |

## Testing Reality

- Python tests cover:
  - startup and config coherence
  - chat routes and worker behavior
  - command bus and tools
  - federation and realtime layers
  - migrations and storage behavior
- Frontend harnesses exist separately for:
  - Vitest
  - Playwright
  - Cypress
- Golden-path regression for architecture work usually means:
  - boot backend successfully
  - create/send/complete a chat turn
  - upload a document and observe embedding lifecycle
  - invoke a command bus command and inspect run events
