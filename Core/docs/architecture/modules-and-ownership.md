Purpose: Provide a subsystem-level map of Codexify so planning can follow real dependency edges, ownership conversations can start from actual seams, and blast radius is visible before code changes land.

## Dependency Edges That Matter Most

- `guardian/guardian_api.py` is the top-level composition root.
  - Changing startup order or router inclusion can break unrelated subsystems at once.
- `guardian/core/chat_completion_service.py` sits at the center of the core assistant loop.
  - It depends on retrieval, prompting, provider routing, DB access, and task/event plumbing.
- `guardian/routes/media.py` is both a user-facing API and an ingestion orchestrator.
  - It couples storage, parsing, dedupe, DB writes, and queueing.
- The legacy tools shim has been removed from the primary app.
  - Tool changes now stay on the command bus surface only.
- Frontend shell code in `AppShell.tsx` depends on several backend contracts directly and also coordinates local browser state.

## High-Coupling Hotspots

- `guardian/guardian_api.py`
- `guardian/routes/chat.py`
- `guardian/core/chat_completion_service.py`
- `guardian/routes/media.py`
- `guardian/routes/command_bus.py`
- `frontend/src/components/persona/layout/AppShell.tsx`

These files are the fastest way to change system behavior and the fastest way to create multi-subsystem regressions.

## Ownership Guidance

This repo does not declare formal team ownership in code, so the grouping below is a recommendation derived from coupling:

- Core loop cluster:
  - chat routes
  - completion service and chat worker
  - context broker
  - prompt/profile system
  - provider routing
- Retrieval and ingestion cluster:
  - media/doc routes
  - embedding workers
  - vector/memory layers
- Platform and control-plane cluster:
  - API bootstrap
  - auth boundary
  - queues/events
  - persistence
  - command bus
  - cron
  - websocket/realtime
- Experimental boundary cluster:
  - federation
  - sync API
  - legacy tools shim

## Change Planning Heuristics

- If a change touches the chat API contract, inspect:
  - `guardian/routes/chat.py`
  - `guardian/core/chat_completion_service.py`
  - `frontend/src/features/chat/`
  - `tests/routes/test_chat_routes.py`
- If a change touches document ingestion, inspect:
  - `guardian/routes/media.py`
  - `guardian/workers/document_embed_worker.py`
  - `guardian/context/broker.py`
  - `tests/routes/test_media_routes.py`
- If a change touches tools or automation, inspect:
  - `guardian/routes/command_bus.py`
  - `guardian/command_bus/invoke.py`
  - `guardian/routes/command_bus.py`
  - `guardian/routes/cron.py`
  - `tests/routes/test_command_bus_*`
