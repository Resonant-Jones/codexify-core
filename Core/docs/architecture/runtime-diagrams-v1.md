# Codexify Runtime Diagrams v1

## Purpose

This document is the first-pass runtime diagram pack derived only from the validated runtime KB source set. It is a baseline runtime view for peer review, not a final presentation artifact.

## Source set used

- `/docs/architecture/00-current-state.md`
- `/docs/architecture/README.md`
- `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md`
- `/docs/architecture/flows.md`
- `/docs/architecture/data-and-storage.md`
- `/docs/architecture/config-and-ops.md`
- `/docs/architecture/modules-and-ownership.md`

## Interpretation constraints

- `00-current-state.md` overrides broader docs on short-horizon release reality.
- These diagrams reflect the current runtime baseline, not aspirational architecture.
- Optional or not-currently-active systems are labeled explicitly.
- Quarantined legacy docs were not used.

## Diagram legend

- `durable`: persisted state or system-of-record surfaces that the validated runtime docs treat as restart-stable.
- `operational / ephemeral`: queues, locks, event transport, or process-local state that keep the runtime moving but are not primary durable truth.
- `optional`: present in current runtime docs but not required for the baseline supported path.
- `feature-flagged`: available only when explicit runtime flags or policy enable it.
- `release-bounded exclusion`: intentionally omitted from v1 because the validated runtime docs do not treat it as part of the present release promise.

## Diagram 1: Runtime Topology Overview

### high confidence

This is a coarse runtime topology map for the validated baseline.

```mermaid

    subgraph clients["Client Boundary"]
        browser["Browser"]
        tauri["Tauri desktop shell<br/>(optional client shell)"]
        frontend["React frontend"]
        client_state["Local/session storage"]
    end

    subgraph runtime["Supported local runtime (Docker Compose)"]
        backend["FastAPI backend"]
        event_surface["Event surfaces<br/>/api/events and /api/tasks/*/events"]
        workers["Worker layer<br/>chat, chat-embed, document-embed, warmup, cron"]
        context["Context + retrieval orchestration"]
        ingestion["Media + document ingestion"]
        command["Command bus + legacy tools shim<br/>(beta / internal-only surfaces)"]
    end

    subgraph durable["Durable stores"]
        postgres["Postgres<br/>system of record"]
        vector["Vector store<br/>message and document embeddings"]
        media_store["File/object storage<br/>media and generated artifacts"]
    end

    subgraph operational["Operational transport"]
        redis["Redis<br/>queues, locks, task events, heartbeats"]
    end

    subgraph optional["Optional / feature-flagged"]
        neo4j["Neo4j<br/>optional / feature-flagged graph context<br/>(not part of baseline release path)"]
    end

    subgraph model_boundary["Model execution boundary"]
        provider["Local or cloud model provider<br/>selected by runtime config and policy"]
    end

    frontend <--> client_state

    context <--> vector

```

Supported runtime topology is the local Docker Compose stack. Non-Compose deployment remains unverified in the validated source set.

### Evidence notes

- Primary sources: `/docs/architecture/00-current-state.md`, `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md`, `/docs/architecture/config-and-ops.md`
- Conservative assumptions: worker types are collapsed into one worker layer, event surfaces are grouped into one runtime boundary, and provider execution is shown as one policy-shaped boundary rather than per-provider lanes.
- Explicit exclusions: non-Compose deployment detail, one-shot bootstrap services, federation/sync surfaces, and provider inventory/governance nuance beyond the current execution boundary.

## Diagram 2: Chat Completion Sequence

### high confidence

This sequence keeps the baseline completion loop focused on the enqueue -> worker -> retrieval -> persist -> task-event path documented in the validated runtime set.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant FE as React frontend
    participant API as Chat API route
    participant Redis as Redis queue/task transport
    participant Worker as Chat worker
    participant Ctx as Context broker
    participant PG as Postgres
    participant Vec as Vector store
    participant Neo as Neo4j (optional / feature-flagged)
    participant LLM as Model provider
    participant Stream as Task event surface

    U->>FE: Submit message and request completion
    FE->>API: POST /api/chat/{thread_id}/complete
    API->>Redis: Acquire turn lock
    API->>Redis: Enqueue ChatCompletionTask
    API-->>FE: task_id, turn_id, messages_url, trace_url
    FE->>Stream: Subscribe to /api/tasks/{task_id}/events
    Worker->>Redis: Dequeue task and emit task.running
    Worker->>Ctx: Assemble context
    Ctx->>PG: Load messages, project scope, linked docs
    Ctx->>Vec: Run semantic retrieval
    opt graph context enabled
        Ctx->>Neo: Fetch graph snippets
    end
    Ctx-->>Worker: Context bundle
    Worker->>LLM: Completion request
    LLM-->>Worker: Assistant output
    Worker->>PG: Persist assistant message and audit/domain events
    Worker->>Redis: Publish task.completed and release turn lock
    Redis-->>Stream: Task events available
    Stream-->>FE: Task lifecycle updates
    FE->>API: Refresh messages_url
    API-->>FE: Updated thread/messages
```

This sequence keeps the baseline completion loop focused on the current enqueue -> worker -> retrieval -> persist -> task-event path documented in the validated runtime set.

### Evidence notes

- Primary sources: `/docs/architecture/flows.md`, `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md`, `/docs/architecture/00-current-state.md`
- Conservative assumptions: the task-event surface is shown as one actor, context assembly is compressed to its stable data dependencies, and the user-message step is collapsed into the request lane so the completion path stays readable.
- Explicit exclusions: provider catalog nuance, failure/retry branches, memory/sensor/federated context branches, and any future delegation or orchestration lanes.

## Diagram 3: Data and Storage Boundaries

### high confidence

This boundary map emphasizes durable state versus operational transport. Redis is operationally critical but not the system of record; Postgres remains the durable source of truth in the validated runtime set.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph runtime["Runtime surfaces"]
        frontend["React frontend / optional Tauri client shell"]
        backend["FastAPI routes + workers"]
    end

    subgraph durable["Durable / persisted state"]
        postgres["Postgres<br/>threads, messages, projects, memories,<br/>document metadata, audit, command runs,<br/>cron runs, events_outbox"]
        vector["Vector store<br/>semantic corpus for messages and documents"]
        media["File/object storage<br/>uploaded/generated media and artifacts"]
    end

    subgraph operational["Operational / ephemeral transport"]
        redis["Redis<br/>chat/document/cron queues,<br/>turn locks, task events, heartbeats"]
        buses["In-process buses<br/>fallback event fanout and sync subscription"]
    end

    subgraph client_local["Client-local state"]
        browser_state["Local/session storage<br/>auth/session state, runtime overrides,<br/>drafts, UI preferences"]
    end

    subgraph optional["Optional / feature-flagged"]
        neo4j["Neo4j<br/>optional / feature-flagged graph context<br/>(not part of baseline release path)"]
    end

    frontend <--> browser_state
    frontend --> backend
    backend <--> postgres
    backend <--> redis
    backend <--> vector
    backend <--> media
    backend -. process-local only .-> buses
    backend -. optional / feature-flagged .-> neo4j
```

**Evidence notes**

### Evidence notes

- Primary sources: `/docs/architecture/data-and-storage.md`, `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md`, `/docs/architecture/00-current-state.md`
- Conservative assumptions: routes and workers share one runtime access node, vector storage is shown as one logical retrieval store, and file/object storage is grouped as one artifact boundary.
- Explicit exclusions: entity-level schema detail, unverified retention/encryption claims, experimental sync durability, and backend-specific vector implementation detail.

## Diagram 4: Subsystem / Ownership Map

### moderate confidence

This is a seam map, not a call graph. It groups subsystem boundaries and conservative dependency direction; it does not enumerate every route, file, or runtime edge.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph frontend_boundary["Frontend boundary"]
        shell["Frontend shell + session spine"]
        transport["Frontend transport + auth client"]
    end

    subgraph api_boundary["API / route layer"]
        bootstrap["API bootstrap + auth/exposure boundary"]
        chat["Chat routes + thread lifecycle"]
        media["Media/document routes"]
        command["Command bus + legacy tools shim<br/>(command bus internal-only in supported beta)"]
        cron["Cron routes + scheduled automation"]
    end

    subgraph core_services["Core services"]
        completion["Completion assembly + chat worker"]
        retrieval["Context + retrieval broker"]
        prompt["Prompt + profile system"]
        provider["Provider routing + catalog"]
        embed["Embedding + vector indexing"]
    end

    subgraph platform["Queue / workers / persistence"]
        queue["Queue + task transport"]
        persistence["Persistence + durable events"]
    end

    shell --> transport
    transport --> bootstrap
    bootstrap --> chat
    bootstrap --> media
    bootstrap --> command
    bootstrap --> cron
    chat --> queue
    chat --> persistence
    queue --> completion
    queue --> embed
    completion --> retrieval
    completion --> prompt
    completion --> provider
    retrieval --> persistence
    media --> queue
    media --> persistence
    embed --> persistence
    command --> persistence
    cron --> queue
    cron --> persistence
```

### Evidence notes
This is a seam map, not a call graph. It groups subsystem boundaries and conservative dependency direction; it does not enumerate every route, file, or runtime edge.

- Primary sources: `/docs/architecture/modules-and-ownership.md`, `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md`, `/docs/architecture/README.md`
- Conservative assumptions: subsystem clusters are grouped at seam level rather than file level, queue/workers/persistence are collapsed into one platform lane, and command bus plus legacy tools are shown together because the validated docs describe them as coexisting runtime surfaces.
- Explicit exclusions: experimental federation/sync boundary detail, collaboration/websocket detail, formal team ownership labels, and file-level hotspot rendering.

## Omitted / intentionally excluded areas

- Experimental federation and sync surfaces are not diagrammed in v1 because `00-current-state.md` says federation and sync durability are not part of the present release promise.
- Future federation concepts and other future-feature architecture documents are excluded.
- Legacy Threadspace / GuardianOS / installer-era material is excluded.
- UI canon, token, layout, and rendering diagrams are excluded.
- Roadmap-only material and supplementary deep dives are excluded.
- Speculative provider or future architecture details that exceed the validated runtime source set are excluded.

## Reviewer guidance

This pack is a baseline runtime map. Resolve disagreements by checking the validated runtime KB first. If a proposed edge cannot be supported by that source set, remove it or mark it unverified before expanding the pack.
